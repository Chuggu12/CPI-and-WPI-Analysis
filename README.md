# CPI-and-WPI-Analysis

In sql we formed two tables cpi and wpi, with the use of basic commands like wildcards, max, min, wildcards, average and a little of joints command; 
<br> Here all data types in the table are of varchar and created cpi and wpi, our objective is to analyze the two tables compare the prices across the months for the wpi and finding how much percentage increases and decreases with respect to commodities

<br>Similarly, for cpi table, we compare rural, urban, and combined columns, cross check the value of columns
and at last, we use both tables to see the common value and compare their wpi and cpi through and also check the value in the columns using basic arithmetic operations available in sql.
